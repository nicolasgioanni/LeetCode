      <ul>
        <li>Go left as far as possible, pushing nodes onto a stack</li>

**Construct Binary Tree From Preorder And Inorder Traversal** *([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/) | [Solution](../Problems/0105.%20Construct%20Binary%20Tree%20From%20Preorder%20And%20Inorder%20Traversal/solution.py))*
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
- **Notes:**
  <ul>
    <li>Idea: Preorder gives the root; Inorder tells us how to split into subtress
      <ul>
        <li>Make a Inorder index dictonary to map the inorder values to indices for O(1) loopups</li>
        <li>Nested recursive function with four pointer parameters: preorder left and right, inorder left and right
          <ul>
            <li>Base case: Make sure that our left pointers for both preorder and in order do not cross eachother (okay is equal)</li>
            <li>Root: Always build our root node with the preorder list index at our preorder left pointer</li>
            <li>Split: We find the index of that value in the preorder list, in the inorder list (rootIndex) using our dictionary</li>
            <li>Left Size (leftHalf): Compute how many nodes are in the left subtree by subtracting the inorder index (root Index) by our inorder left pointer</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Recurse Left:
      <ul>
        <li>preLeft: Move forward by 1 (skip over the root in preorder).</li>
        <li>preRight: Move our pointer to our current preLeft + the number of nodes in the leftHalf</li>
        <li>inLeft: Keep the same inLeft</li>
        <li>inRight: Move our pointer to the middle (rootIndex) - 1 to exclude our current root node (everything to the left of the root in inorder)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Recurse Right:
      <ul>
        <li>preLeft: Move the pointer over by 1 + our current preLeft + the length of the leftHalf</li>
        <li>preRight: Keep the same preRight</li>
        <li>inLeft: Move our pointer to the rootIndex + 1 (everything to the right of the root in inorder).</li>
        <li>inRight: Keep the same inRight</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Note: Only compare or use index values together if they are part of the same list</li>

**Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum** *([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/) | [Solution](../Problems/0124.%20Binary%20Tree%20Maximum%20Path%20Sum/solution.py))*
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(h) or log(n)
- **Notes:**
  <ul>
    <li>Idea: Recurse through every node and return 2 things:
      <ul>
        <li>The highest count path you can extend upwards (straight path)
          <ul>
            <li>We return our current nodes value + either the left path, right path, or 0 (if the left and right path are 0)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The best count path you can find anywhere in the tree (split path)
          <ul>
            <li>We return either our current best count, or our current nodes value + left path + right path</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Base case: if the node is null, return 0 and -infinity as the best count path (anything is better than a null node)</li>
  </ul>

## Graphs

**Number of Islands** *([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) | [Solution](../Problems/0200.%20Number%20of%20Islands/solution.py))*
- **Time Complexity:** O(n): O(row * col)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n): O(row * col)
- **Notes:**
  <ul>
    <li>Idea: Iterate through each coordinate (row and col) in grid/matrix and run bfs or dfs every time we see a unvisited island coordinate (not in set)</li>
    <li>BFS or DFS: Logic works for both below but bfs pops left vs. dfs pops right
      <ul>
        <li>Add the first coordinate to our visited set and to our queue (collections.deque)</li>
        <li>While loop as long as we have valid coordinates in our queue</li>
        <li>For loop to check all directions (left/right/up/down) of our current coordinates, if any of those coordinates:
          <ul>
            <li>Are within our row and col bounds (0 to the length of 0-indexed range)</li>
            <li>Is an island in our grid (grid[row][col] == "x")</li>
            <li>And is not in our visited set</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Means: we found another valid coordinate a part of this island, and we update our visited set and queue with those coordinates to reiterate</li>
        <li>Otherwise: we do nothing until the queue is empty</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

**Clone Graph** *([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/) | [Solution](../Problems/0133.%20Clone%20Graph/solution.py))*
- **Time Complexity:** O(V * E)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V)
- **Notes:**
  <ul>
    <li>Idea: Recursively clone each node using the old node and returning the cloned node (whether it's already cloned or not):
      <ol type="1">
        <li>If the old node is already in the map, return its clone (because our recursive call takes in the old node)</li>
        <li>Otherwise, create the clone and update our hashmap (old : new) that the node has been copied.</li>
        <li>For each neighbor of the old node, get the neighbor’s clone by recursion and append it to the current clone’s neighbors</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Question: Why the hashmap?</li>
    <li>Answer: It is both the visited check and the way to fetch the exact clone needed to wire edges (when we are updating neighbors of already cloned nodes)</li>
  </ul>

**Pacific Atlantic Water Flow** *([Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/) | [Solution](../Problems/0417.%20Pacific%20Atlantic%20Water%20Flow/solution.py))*
- **Time Complexity:** O(n): O(row * col)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n): O(row * col)
- **Notes:**
  <ul>
    <li>Idea: Iterate through top/bottom, left/right sides and recursivly dfs go inward storing valid coordinates in sets (coordinates that are in a path to ocean)
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Top/Bottom: Iterate through cols and recursive dfs on every coordinate on the top and bottom row (0, rows -1)</li>
        <li>Left/Right: Iterate through rows and recursive dfs on every coordinate on the left and right cols (0, cols - 1)</li>
        <li>DFS: If the row/col is within bounds, the coordinate has a equal or greater height than our old, and is not already marked reachable:
          <ul>
            <li>Mark it as reachable for that respective ocean</li>
            <li>Recursively check all 4 directions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Result: Iterate over one ocean’s reachable set and add any cell that also appears in the other ocean’s set to the result.</li>
  </ul>
